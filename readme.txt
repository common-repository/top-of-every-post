This plugin adds some content to the top of every post. That is all. No extra crap.

== Description ==

This plugin does one thing, and that thing is to add some content to the beginning of each
of your posts. This change happens on the fly, so if you deactivate or uninstall this
plugin, the feature goes away. 

I created this plugin because I have a similar plugin called bottom of every post, and
someone on twitter said they wanted one for the top.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins folder, or use the Plugins > Add New section of your dashboard to search for "top of every post"
1. Visit Plugins > Editor and choose Top of every post from the drop down list in the upper right
1. Modify `top-of-every-post.txt` to contain the content you would like at the top of every post and save your changes
1. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
